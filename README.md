# Music-Event-Site-Concept
A simple design and flow concept for a music event website, created for a university assignment. Makes use of Bootstrap 5 for grid layout and components, and of Google Fonts.

This site would allow people to browse music gigs and events near them, by genre, location or search term. 

To explore, simply download all files and open index.html, this file works as the home page. From here you can see the home page layout, view events (all route to one static page), view a user's booked and past events, or view the event creation page via the navbar.

Hope you enjoy!
